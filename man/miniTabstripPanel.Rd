\usage{
miniTabstripPanel(..., id = NULL, selected = NULL, between = NULL)

miniTabPanel(title, ..., value = title, icon = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{For \code{miniTabstripPanel}, \code{miniTabPanel} elements to
include in the tabset. For \code{miniTabPanel}, UI elements to include
within the tab.}

\item{id}{If provided, you can use \code{input$}\emph{\code{id}} in your
server logic to determine which of the current tabs is active. The value
will correspond to the \code{value} argument that is passed to
\code{\link{miniTabPanel}}.}

\item{selected}{The \code{value} (or, if none was supplied, the \code{title})
of the tab that should be selected by default. If \code{NULL}, the first
tab will be selected.}

\item{between}{A tag or list of tags that should be inserted between the
content (above) and tabstrip (below).}

\item{title}{Display title for tab.}

\item{value}{The value that should be sent when \code{miniTabstripPanel}
reports that this tab is selected. If omitted and \code{miniTabstripPanel}
has an \code{id}, then the tab's title will be used as the value.}

\item{icon}{Icon to appear on the tab; see \code{\link[shiny]{icon}}.}

\description{
\code{miniTabstripPanel} is a tabstrip panel that contains
\code{miniTabPanel} elements. Similar to \code{\link[shiny]{tabsetPanel}},
but optimized for small page sizes like mobile devices or the RStudio Viewer
pane.
